Description of the approach used to solve the project:
---------------------------------------
GOAL:
    -inspection employees: are responsible to first make sure
                            the medicine has been produced against the proper standard
    -packaging employees: are responsible to place the medicine in packages and then place 
                        the drug prescription in the same package
---------------------------------------

    -------
    Liquid Production Lines, Pill-Based Production Lines
    -------

---------------------------------------
LIQUID LINES:
    Inspection:
        – Liquid level inside bottles is within the normal range,
        – Liquid color matches expected color,
        – Medicine bottles are properly sealed,
        – Correct label is properly placed on the bottle,
        – Medicine expiry date is clearly printed on the bottle and is correct.
    Packaging:
        - place the bottles in bottles containers and add folded prescription to each package

----------------------------------------
PILL BASED LINES:
    Inspection:
    – No plastic container is missing any pill,
    – Pills in the plastic containers have the correct color and size,
    – Medicine expiry date is clearly printed on the plastic container back.

    Packaging:
    - put the right number of plastic containers in the packages in addition to folded
      prescription
----------------------------------------
medicine production lines don't all speed at the same speed.
when need arises, employess from a production line goes to another production line to help
----------------------------------------
The simulation ends if:

    – The pharmaceutical factory has produced a medicine type above a user-defined
    threshold.
    – Too many bottled medicine are out of spec.
    – Too many pill-based medicine are out of spec.
    – The simulation has been running for more than a user-defined amount of time
    (in minutes).

The production lines are processes and the
inspection & packaging employees are threads that belong to a particular production
line.
